A lightweight equivalent for kanban.

* `backlog.md` - an unorganized, mostly unordered list of tasks. Tasks are deleted from here and moved into `active.md`.
* `active.md` - a prioritized list of current tasks for the current feature. Tasks are ticked off as completed. When the feature is complete, this is moved to `history/`
* `history/` - directory of completed task lists
