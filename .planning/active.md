# Active tasks

* [X] represent continents as polygons rather than a region grid
* [X] split up polygon continents into simple biomes
	* coastlines are now identifiable!
	* [X] add render zoom level to see polygon edges clearly
* [o] global temperature map
* [o] global moisure map
* [ ] biomes dictate basic height range
	* e.g. sea = -40-0, coast = 0-20, hilly = 15-40 etc
* [ ] fix temperature when combined with elevation
* [ ] ensure heightmap is still present underwater
* [ ] override initial camera chunk with 0,0 for preset worlds
* [X] restrict slab loading to planet boundary, wrapping can wait
