# name-needed

Utility crates for [Name Needed](https://domwillia.ms), a one man effort to produce an **intuitive** and **high performance** Dwarf Fortress-esque game. Needs a name.

If you are looking for the actual game, see [this blog post](https://domwillia.ms/closed-sourcening) and [the archive](https://github.com/DomWilliams0/name-needed-archive).
